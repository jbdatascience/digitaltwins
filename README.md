# digitaltwins

This package carries out the Digital Twin Test to analyze genetic trio data sets.

The Digital Twin Test can be used for statistical inference
while taking advantage of arbitrary multivariate models and fitting
procedures. Importantly, it is guaranteed to only detect causal regions, regardless of the 
true relationship between the genotypes and the outcome. 
The full methodology is described in the manuscript [Establishing Causality in Trio Studies with the Digital Twin Test](http://web.stanford.edu/~stephen6/index.html) by Stephen Bates, Matteo Sesia, Chiara Sabatti, and Emmanuel Cand√®s.
